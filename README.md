## Currently working on
+ Ultimate autopair v0.7
+ [nelisp](https://github.com/altermo/nelisp)
<!-- Nothing. -->
<!--#### Neovim wayland window manager
Currently I still have not got a singular window to display. The project is currently using wlroots. When the project is complete, it will replace the existing [nxwm](https://github.com/altermo/nxwm) repository, and the repository will be renamed to `nwm`(Neovim window manager). The progress on this is slow, as I have no idea what I'm doing. \
Current status: still have no window displayed on screen and random crashes-->
